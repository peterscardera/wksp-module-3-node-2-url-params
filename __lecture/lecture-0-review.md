# 3.2.0 - Review concepts

## EJS

- What's the difference between these two?

```js
<%- myVar %>
<%= myVar %>
```

_...Why do we have two options?_

---

What is this for?

```js
<%- include('<PATH_TO_EJS_FILE', {}) %>
```

_...What makes this so powerful?_

---

What notation do we use to run JS snippets inside of an `.ejs` file?

`const array = ['one', 'two', 'three']`

```js
// Example
<ul>
    array.forEach(element => {
        <li>element</li>
    });
</ul>
```

---

## Express

- What express _routing method_ did we use yesterday?
- What are its parameters?
- What is the minimum amount of code to set up an express server?

```js
// Example

app.get(path,function(request, response) {} ) //response used to send back stuff

//What is the minimum amount of code to set up an express server?
const express = require("espress);
const app = express();


app.get("/hello",function(request, response) {}
response.send("hello") 



app.listen(8000), console.log("server is up! on port 8000")

```
